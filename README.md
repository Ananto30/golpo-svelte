# Golpo Svelte

This is the svelte build of the [golpo.dedsec.life](https://golpo.dedsec.life). It's a rebuild of the old app - [golpo13.herokuapp.com](http://golpo13.herokuapp.com/) that was built on React.

**Golpo is a link sharing platform without ads.**

But we would like to have people's opinion on what Golpo can have in future. Please share your thoughts and feature request **[here](https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo-express/discussions/categories/request-feature).**
