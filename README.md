# Golpo Svelte

This is the svelte build of the current [golpo project](https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo). Site - [golpo.dedsec.life](http://golpo.dedsec.life/)

But there are things we are changing from the current Golpo. We will use Golpo as a link sharing platform. And it will be free for eveyone! Future plan involves link management (collection of links and sorting) and sharing collection.

So here is our plan -

## Change plan

### Backend

*   Verify post is only a link.
*   Extract meta data from link and save them in the database.
*   Do not allow to share the same link in 24 hours.
*   Add like count and people who liked the post.
*   Add follow functionality.

### Frontend

*   Convert from React to Svelte.
*   Separate page for chats and user chat. (Chats are list of users who I have chat with in the past and UserChat is a single user chatting interface)
*   Profile edit page or modal.
*   Send message to user button and modal.

## Run the project

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Svelte tasks

Please note that most of the frontend data model is already there, I will add more soon.

And to get actual api response, you need to run the backend too. Check the backend - [github.com/ananto30/golpo-express](https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo-express)
